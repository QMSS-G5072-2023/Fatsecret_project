# Fatsecret_project
This is a python wrapper for fatsecret platform.
I create this python package for users to easily use FatSecret function. 
    Firstly, users can search for food brands when they feel it hard to decide which restruants to go to. The brand type includes "manufacturer", "restaurant" and "supermarket", and users can choose either one they want. 
    Secondly, the food categories category will make users to easier find a category for a food. They can use this function to know whether they may allergy to this food (by trace its categoy), and to know what kind of fodd they ate (this will be very efficient for users who want to balance the categories of foods they eat daily). 
    Thirdly, food sub categories will work in a similar way as the second one, but it classfied food more detaily. 
    Forthly, users can add favorite recipe, delete receipe and get all favorites in recipe by using this package. 
    The last one will give all supported recipe type names for users, which make it easier for them to make personal menu.
